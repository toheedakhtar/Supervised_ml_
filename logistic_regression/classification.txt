classification is getting either yes or no output: 
for ex:
if an animal is cat or not - either yes or no

what is the wieght of cat on basis of height is not a classification problem, but a linear regression problem?

other ex o classification are - 
- is this tumor malignant?
- is this email spam?
- if animal is a dog?

all above examples can be answered in yes or no, true or false, 1 or 0
1 being True or yes and 0 being False or No.

This type of classification is known as Binary classification.

Linear Regeression algorithms are not fit to solve classification problems, to solve classification problems we use Logistic Regression which.

Both Logistic Regression and Linear Regression are different.

Logistic Regeression is the most used algorithm for classification
